# Machine Learning

This repo contains tests by me, while learning neural networks.

## Linear-regression
The code is about linear regression or the modelling of relationship between variables.
First is **analytic** approach.
Then is **perceptron** or machine learning approach.
Y=mx+c

With least square error minimization
Library used: *matplotlib*

## KNN Data classification
Classifying data using K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm, data set used: Wisconsin breast cancer dataset.
Library used:  *numpy*,*pandas*

## K-Means Cluster
Along with standard *Elbow* method for determining number of clusters, K.

## Backpropagation implementation
Backpropagation is an algorithm based on gradient descent, is applied to a nueral network here.
Library used: *numpy*
