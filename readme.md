# Aritificial Neural Net

This repo contains tests by me, while learning neural networks.

## Linear-regression
The code is about linear regression or the modelling of relationship between variables.
First is **analytic** approach
Then is **perceptron** or machine learning approach.

It is about plotting a straight line.
Library used: *matplotlib*

## KNN Data Clustering
Classifying data using K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm, data set used: Wisconsin breast cancer dataset
Library used: *numpy*
              *pandas*
